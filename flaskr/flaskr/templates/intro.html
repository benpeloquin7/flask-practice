    <p class="block-text">In the following task you will see several sentences.
        In every sentence, one word will be highlighted in <font
                color="blue"><b>blue</b></font>. We want you to tell us some
        other words the speaker could have used if they had felt differently
        about their experience.</p>

    <p class="block-text">For example, if you see a sentence like...</p>
    <p class="block-text">
        <center>"<i>In a recent review, someone said they thought the comedian was
            <font color="blue"><b>funny</b></font></i>."
        </center>
    </p>
    <p class="block-text">...some possible alternatives you might consider
        could be '<i>boring</i>', '<i>dull</i>', or '<i>hilarious</i>'.</p>

    <p class="block-text">Please consider the context in which the word was
        used and simply list the first three alternatives that come to mind -
        weâ€™re interested in your spontaneous response!</p>
